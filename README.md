# Building a Functional 32-bit RISC Microprocessor
This project was a comprehensive journey in hardware design using Verilog, leading to the construction of a fully functional 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It began with mastering the basics of Verilog and designing foundational hardware modules. I then integrated these components using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave, employing wiring, multiplexors, and logic gates to create the logic behind a partially functional CPU. This phase emphasized the importance of component integration and creating a cohesive system from individual parts.

Building on this, I implemented additional components and re-interconnected existing modules to enhance the CPU's functionality, focusing on designing a Control Unit to manage operations. The project culminated in refining the CPU by splitting it into the standard five MIPS stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). I introduced elemental hazard control to manage instruction execution overlaps by modifying the control unit or adding extra hazard control mechanisms. Through these iterative developments, I gained hands-on experience in component integration, control unit design, and hazard management, culminating in a deep understanding of CPU architecture and functionality.
