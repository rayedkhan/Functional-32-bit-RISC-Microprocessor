# Functional-32-bit-RISC-Microprocessor
Designed a 32-bit RISC microprocessor using Verilog, from learning basic HDL concepts to assembling and refining a CPU with advanced control mechanisms. Via iterative developments, I gained experience in component integration, control unit design, and hazard management, culminating in a deep understanding of CPU architecture and functionality.
